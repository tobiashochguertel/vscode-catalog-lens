## Features

- ✅ Support for **PNPM** catalogs (via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- ✅ Support for **Yarn** catalogs (via `.yarnrc.yml`)
- ✅ Support for **Bun** catalogs (via `package.json` with `catalog` or `catalogs` fields)
- ✅ **Multi-root workspace support** - Works seamlessly with VS Code multi-root workspaces
- ✅ Inline version display with color-coded named catalogs
- ✅ Hover information with catalog name and version
- ✅ Go-to-definition support to jump to catalog definition
- ✅ Works with both default (`catalog:`) and named catalogs (`catalog:name`)

## Multi-Root Workspace Support

This extension fully supports VS Code's [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces). When you have multiple workspace folders open, the extension will:

- Automatically detect the correct workspace configuration file for each `package.json` being edited
- Use `findUp` to traverse from the current file to locate the nearest workspace root
- Support different package managers in different workspace folders (e.g., PNPM in one folder, Bun in another)
- Cache workspace lookups for performance

## Bun Catalogs Support

This extension supports Bun's catalog feature as documented at <https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces#catalogs>

Bun catalogs can be defined in your root `package.json` in two ways:

### 1. At the top level

```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "catalog": {
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
  },
  "catalogs": {
    "testing": {
      "jest": "30.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Within the workspaces object

```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"],
    "catalog": {
      "react": "^19.0.0",
      "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
    },
    "catalogs": {
      "testing": {
        "jest": "30.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then reference them in workspace packages:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog:",
    "jest": "catalog:testing"
  }
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

This extension uses `pnpm` for dependency management and `vsce` (VS Code Extension Manager) for packaging and publishing.

```bash
# Install pnpm if you don't have it
npm install -g pnpm

# Install @vscode/vsce for publishing
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tobiashochguertel/vscode-catalog-lens.git
cd vscode-catalog-lens

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Testing

The extension includes a test suite using Vitest:

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test --watch
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the extension
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Watch mode for development (rebuilds on file changes)
pnpm dev
```

Then press `F5` in VS Code to launch the extension development host.

### Publishing

```bash
# Package the extension (creates .vsix file)
pnpm package

# Publish to VS Code Marketplace (requires authentication)
pnpm ext:publish

# Or publish to Open VSX
npx ovsx publish

# Create a new release (bumps version and creates git tag)
pnpm release
```

**Note:** VS Code extension publishing works with `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`. This project uses `pnpm` with `vsce --no-dependencies` flag to avoid bundling dependencies that should be bundled by the build process.

### Local CI Validation

This project supports local validation of GitHub Actions workflows before pushing changes, significantly reducing CI failures and feedback time.

#### Prerequisites

Install the required tools:

```bash
# Install actionlint (workflow YAML validator)
brew install actionlint  # macOS
# or: go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest

# Install act (local GitHub Actions runner)
brew install act  # macOS
# or: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Docker is required for act
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running
```

#### Available Commands

**Workflow Validation (Recommended - Fast & Reliable):**

```bash
# Validate all workflow YAML files (actionlint) - Takes <1s
pnpm workflow:lint
# or use the script directly:
./scripts/lint-workflows.sh

# Comprehensive validation (actionlint + basic act check)
pnpm workflow:validate
```

**Local Workflow Execution with act (Advanced):**

> ⚠️ **Note:** Local execution with act requires Docker and may need large images (~2-20GB). Some complex workflows may not work perfectly locally. For most cases, workflow validation with actionlint is sufficient.

```bash
# List all available jobs
./scripts/act-test.sh

# Run specific jobs locally (simulates GitHub Actions environment)
pnpm act:lint        # Run linting job (simple, works well)
pnpm act:typecheck   # Run type checking job (requires Node.js image)
pnpm act:build       # Run build job (requires Node.js image)
pnpm act:test-unix   # Run Unix tests (complex, may have issues)
pnpm act:ci          # Run complete CI pipeline (very resource intensive)
```

**Docker Image Options:**
The project is configured to use `catthehacker/ubuntu:js-*` images (includes Node.js, ~5GB). Alternative configurations in `.actrc`:

- `act-*` - Lightweight (~500MB) but missing many tools
- `js-*` - Includes Node.js (~5GB) - **Default for this project**
- `full-*` - Complete environment (~20GB) - Most compatible but very large

#### Pre-commit Hook Integration

The project uses Husky pre-commit hooks that automatically validate workflows before each commit:

- **Step 7/7:** Workflow validation with actionlint
- Non-blocking warnings if actionlint is not installed
- Validates all `.yml`/`.yaml` files in `.github/workflows/`

To skip pre-commit hooks (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

#### Troubleshooting

**act fails with "Cannot connect to Docker daemon":**

```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running
docker ps
# If fails, start Docker Desktop and try again
```

**actionlint not found during pre-commit:**

```bash
# Install actionlint
brew install actionlint
# or install globally with Go
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest
```

**act fails with "node: executable file not found" or similar:**

```bash
# You may need larger Docker images with more tools pre-installed
# Edit .actrc and change from 'js-*' to 'full-*' images:
# -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:full-latest
# Warning: full images are ~20GB and take time to download

# Alternative: Focus on workflow validation instead
pnpm workflow:lint  # This always works and catches most issues
```

**act workflow execution fails or behaves differently than GitHub:**

```bash
# Some workflows use GitHub-specific features that don't work locally
# Recommendation: Use act for simple jobs (lint, typecheck, build)
# Trust GitHub Actions for complex workflows (tests, deployments)

# To debug: enable verbose logging
act -j lint -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -v
```
