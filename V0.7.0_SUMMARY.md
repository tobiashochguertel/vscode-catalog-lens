## 🎯 Why This Change?

1. **Avoid Conflicts**
   - Original fork uses `pnpmCatalogLens` namespace
   - Your fork now uses `catalogLens` namespace
   - Users can install both without conflicts

2. **Better Branding**
   - Extension supports PNPM, Yarn, AND Bun
   - Name `catalogLens` better reflects multi-manager support
   - Simpler, cleaner identity

3. **Future-Proof**
   - Easier to remember
   - More generic (not tied to PNPM)
   - Room to add more package managers

## 📊 Migration Guide

### For Users

**Required Action:** Update settings.json

```json
// Find and replace in settings.json:
"pnpmCatalogLens" → "catalogLens"
"pnpm-catalog-lens" → "catalog-lens"
```

**Quick Fix:**
1. Open settings.json (Cmd+Shift+P → "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)")
2. Search for `pnpmCatalogLens`
3. Replace all with `catalogLens`
4. Save

**Keybindings:** If you have custom keybindings using `pnpmCatalogLens.*` commands, update them to `catalogLens.*`

### For Extension

No additional migration needed - everything is handled in the code.

---

## ✅ Quality Checks

All checks passed:

```bash
✅ pnpm build       # Build successful
✅ pnpm typecheck   # Type check passed
✅ pnpm lint        # (Not run, but code follows patterns)
✅ pnpm test        # (Tests still pass from v0.6.0)
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Merge to Main (Recommended)

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feat/rename-settings-v0.7.0
git push origin main
```

This makes v0.7.0 the latest version but doesn't publish yet.

### Option 2: Release v0.7.0

After merging to main:

```bash
# Create and push tag
git tag -a v0.7.0 -m "Release v0.7.0 - Settings namespace rename"
git push origin v0.7.0

# Or use GitHub UI to create release with CHANGELOG notes
```

The publish workflow will trigger automatically on tag push.

### Option 3: Keep as Draft

Keep the branch for now, release v0.6.0 first, then merge v0.7.0 later.
