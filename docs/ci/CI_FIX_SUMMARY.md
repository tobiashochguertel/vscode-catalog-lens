# CI Workflow Fix Summary

## üéØ Problem

The `publish.yml` workflow failed during the "Generate Changelog" step with the error:

```log
üîç Running pre-commit checks...
‚ú® Step 1/7: Formatting code with Prettier...
husky - pre-commit script failed (code 1)
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Workflow Run:** <https://github.com/tobiashochguertel/vscode-catalog-lens/actions/runs/18473677672>

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened

1. **File Created:** `WORKFLOW_CHANGES_COMPLETE.md` was created as documentation
2. **Not Formatted:** The file was created without running Prettier formatting
3. **Not Committed:** File was untracked and not included in commit 9d2ce93
4. **Workflow Triggered:** User triggered `publish.yml` workflow manually
5. **Fresh Checkout:** GitHub Actions checked out the repository
6. **Changelog Generation:** Workflow successfully generated changelog
7. **Commit Attempt:** Workflow tried to commit changelog with `git commit -m "chore: update changelog"`
8. **Pre-commit Hook:** Husky pre-commit hook triggered automatically
9. **Prettier Check Failed:** Prettier found `WORKFLOW_CHANGES_COMPLETE.md` unformatted in working directory
10. **Workflow Failed:** Pre-commit hook exited with code 1, stopping the workflow

### Why It Passed Locally But Failed in CI

| Aspect           | Local                                     | CI                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| File Status      | Untracked (not staged)                    | All committed files present in working directory      |
| Pre-commit Scope | Only checks staged files                  | Checks all files in working directory when triggered  |
| When Hook Runs   | During developer's `git commit`           | During workflow's `git commit` (changelog generation) |
| File Visibility  | Not visible to hook (not in staging area) | Visible to hook (in working directory)                |
| Result           | ‚úÖ Hook passed (file not checked)         | ‚ùå Hook failed (file checked and found unformatted)   |

## üîß Solution Applied

### Step 1: Investigation

Used GitHub CLI to retrieve full workflow logs:

```bash
gh run view 18473677672 --log
```

Identified the exact failure point:

- Job: "Prepare Release (Changelog & Version Bump)"
- Step: "Generate Changelog"
- Error: Pre-commit hook failed on Prettier formatting

### Step 2: Local Diagnosis

Checked formatting status locally:

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

Output confirmed the issue:

```
[warn] WORKFLOW_CHANGES_COMPLETE.md
[warn] Code style issues found in 1 file. Run Prettier with --write to fix.
```

### Step 3: Fix

Formatted the file:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Result:

```
‚úì WORKFLOW_CHANGES_COMPLETE.md
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

Committed the formatted file:

```bash
git add WORKFLOW_CHANGES_COMPLETE.md
git commit -m "docs: add formatted workflow changes summary document"
```

**Pre-commit hooks passed:** ‚úÖ

- ‚úì Prettier formatting completed
- ‚úì Markdown linting completed
- ‚úì Lint auto-fix completed
- ‚úì No lint errors
- ‚úì Type check passed
- ‚úì Build successful
- ‚úì Workflow validation passed

Pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git push
```

**Pre-push hooks passed:** ‚úÖ

- ‚úì All 43 tests passed

**Commit:** 47859fa

### Step 5: Verification

Triggered CI workflow automatically on push. All jobs passed:

```log
‚úì lint (17s)
‚úì typecheck (14s)
‚úì build (15s)
‚úì test-windows (1m26s)
‚úì test-unix (macos-latest) (25s)
‚úì test-unix (ubuntu-latest) (18s)
‚úì e2e-unix (ubuntu-latest) (19s)
‚úì e2e-unix (macos-latest) (22s)
‚úì e2e-windows (1m4s)
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Run CI completed with 'success'

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Issue #1: Documentation Files Not Formatted

**Problem:** Created markdown documentation without formatting

**Prevention:**

- Always run `pnpm format` after creating new files
- Check formatting before committing: `pnpm format:check`
- Consider adding a reminder in documentation workflow

### Issue #2: Untracked Files Not Caught Locally

**Problem:** Untracked files bypass pre-commit checks

**Current State:** Our pre-commit hooks already check formatting:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit - Step 1/7
pnpm format > /dev/null 2>&1
```

**Note:** The hook runs `pnpm format` (auto-formats) not just `pnpm format:check`

**Why This Wasn't Caught:**

- File was created after the commit
- File was untracked (not in git index)
- Pre-commit hook only runs when you execute `git commit`
- Hook only checks files that are staged or in the repository

### Issue #3: CI Has Broader Scope Than Local

**Problem:** CI checks more thoroughly than local hooks sometimes

**Explanation:**

- CI performs fresh checkout
- CI workflow creates new files (like changelog)
- When workflow commits these files, ALL files in working directory are subject to pre-commit checks
- Local development may have untracked files that won't cause issues until they're committed

## ‚úÖ Addressing User Requirements

### A) "See errors earlier before we commit"

**Current State:** ‚úÖ Already comprehensive

Our pre-commit hooks include 7 thorough steps:

1. ‚úì Format code with Prettier
2. ‚úì Lint markdown files
3. ‚úì ESLint auto-fix
4. ‚úì Verify no lint errors remain
5. ‚úì Type checking
6. ‚úì Build
7. ‚úì Validate GitHub Actions workflows

**Recommendation:** Continue current approach + add these practices:

1. **Before Final Commit:**

   ```bash
   # Check all files are formatted
   pnpm format:check

   # Run full test suite
   pnpm test

   # Check git status for untracked files
   git status
   ```

2. **For New Documentation:**
   - Always run `pnpm format` after creating `.md` files
   - Commit documentation files immediately after creation
   - Don't leave untracked documentation files

3. **Use Available Scripts:**

   ```bash
   # Full local validation (mimics CI)
   pnpm lint        # Check linting
   pnpm typecheck   # Check types
   pnpm build       # Check build
   pnpm test        # Run tests
   pnpm format:check # Check formatting
   ```

### B) "Don't have such issues anymore in the publish.yml workflow"

**Current State:** ‚úÖ Workflow is well-designed

The publish.yml workflow already includes:

- Pre-commit hooks during changelog generation
- Comprehensive validation before publishing
- Multiple safety checks

**Issue Was Not Workflow Design:** The workflow correctly caught the formatting issue. The problem was that the documentation file wasn't properly formatted before being committed.

**Prevention Strategy:**

1. **Development Workflow:**
   - Create files ‚Üí Format ‚Üí Commit immediately
   - Don't accumulate untracked files
   - Run `git status` regularly to check for untracked files

2. **Documentation Workflow:**

   ```bash
   # When creating new documentation
   vim SOME_DOC.md
   pnpm format
   git add SOME_DOC.md
   git commit -m "docs: add some documentation"
   ```

3. **Before Triggering Workflows:**
   - Ensure working directory is clean: `git status`
   - Check formatting: `pnpm format:check`
   - All changes committed and pushed

1. Go to: <https://github.com/tobiashochguertel/vscode-catalog-lens/actions/workflows/publish.yml>
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select `none` for version increment
4. Workflow should:
