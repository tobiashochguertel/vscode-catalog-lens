# Publish Workflow - Simulation Mode & Act Integration

## üéØ Overview

The publish workflow now supports:

1. **Simulation Mode** - Test the entire publish workflow without actually publishing
2. **Proper Main Branch Sync** - Changelog and version changes are now properly available in all jobs
3. **Act Integration** - Test the workflow locally before pushing to GitHub

---

## üîç Simulation Mode

### What It Does

Simulation mode allows you to **test the complete publish workflow** without:

- ‚ùå Pushing changes to the main branch
- ‚ùå Pushing tags to the repository
- ‚ùå Publishing to VS Code Marketplace
- ‚ùå Publishing to Open VSX Registry
- ‚ùå Creating GitHub Releases

But **WITH**:

- ‚úÖ Generating the changelog
- ‚úÖ Bumping the version
- ‚úÖ Running all tests
- ‚úÖ Building and packaging the extension
- ‚úÖ Showing what **would** happen

### How to Use

#### GitHub UI

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Publish Extension** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Set **mode** to `simulate`
5. Configure other options (version increment, etc.)
6. Click **Run workflow**

#### GitHub CLI

```bash
# Simulate a patch release
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=simulate \
  -f version_increment=patch \
  -f skip_changelog=false

# Simulate without version bump (test changelog only)
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=simulate \
  -f version_increment=none \
  -f skip_changelog=false
```

### What You'll See

The workflow will complete with a **Simulation Summary** showing:

- ‚úÖ What was tested (changelog, version, tests, build)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è What was skipped (publishing steps)
- üì¶ Package information (version, VSIX file)
- üí° Reminder to run with `mode=real` to actually publish

---

## üöÄ Real Mode (Actual Publishing)

When you're ready to actually publish:

### GitHub UI

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Publish Extension** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Set **mode** to `real`
5. Configure options (version increment, marketplace, etc.)
6. Click **Run workflow**

### GitHub CLI

```bash
# Publish a patch release to all marketplaces
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=real \
  -f version_increment=patch \
  -f publish_marketplace=true \
  -f publish_openvsx=true \
  -f create_release=true
```

## üìù Main Branch Synchronization

### The Problem (Before)

Previously, when the publish workflow:

1. Generated changelog
2. Bumped version
3. Pushed changes to main

The subsequent jobs (test, build, publish) would checkout `main` **before** those changes were pushed, so they would be working with **outdated** `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

This meant the GitHub release tag had the updated files, but the `main` branch didn't get them until someone manually pushed.

### The Solution (Now)

**All jobs now:**

1. Checkout the `main` branch
2. **Pull latest changes** (including changelog/version updates)
3. Work with the most up-to-date files

**Result:**

- ‚úÖ Changelog updates are in `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Version bumps are in `main` branch
- ‚úÖ GitHub releases match `main` branch
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed

## üß™ Act Integration - Local Testing

### Prerequisites

Install `act` if you haven't already:

```bash
# macOS
brew install act

# Linux
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Or see: https://github.com/nektos/act#installation
```

### Available Commands

#### Test Publish Workflow (Simulation)

```bash
# Run the workflow in simulation mode locally
pnpm act:publish:simulate
```

This will:

- Run all preparation steps (changelog, version bump)
- Run tests
- Build and package the extension
- **Skip** actual publishing (local simulation)
- Show what would happen without side effects

#### Test Publish Workflow (Real - BE CAREFUL!)

```bash
# Run the workflow in real mode locally (will try to publish!)
pnpm act:publish
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will attempt to actually publish if secrets are available. Use `simulate` mode for testing!

### How It Works

The `act` tool:

1. Reads your GitHub Actions workflow files
2. Runs them in Docker containers locally
3. Simulates the GitHub Actions environment
4. Shows output as if running in GitHub

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Test changes before pushing
- ‚úÖ Faster feedback loop
- ‚úÖ No need to clutter GitHub Actions history
- ‚úÖ Catch issues early

### Limitations

- Some GitHub-specific features may not work perfectly
- Requires Docker to be running
- Secrets need to be provided separately (or use simulation mode)

## üí° Best Practices

### Before Publishing

1. **Test locally first:**

   ```bash
   pnpm act:publish:simulate
   ```

2. **Test on GitHub in simulation mode:**

   ```bash
   gh workflow run publish.yml -f mode=simulate -f version_increment=patch
   ```

3. **Review the simulation summary** to ensure everything looks correct

4. **Run actual publish:**

   ```bash
   gh workflow run publish.yml -f mode=real -f version_increment=patch
   ```

### For Major Releases

1. Use simulation mode to test
2. Review changelog carefully
3. Consider using `skip_changelog=true` and manually editing CHANGELOG.md
4. Bump version with `major`
5. Publish with `mode=real`

### For Hotfixes

1. Use `version_increment=patch`
2. Keep changelog generation enabled
3. Use simulation mode first
4. Publish quickly with `mode=real`

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Changelog not updating

**Solution:** Make sure `skip_changelog=false` and you have conventional commits since last release.

### Issue: Version not bumping

**Solution:** Check that `version_increment` is not `none`.

### Issue: Publish jobs skipped

**Solution:** Ensure `mode=real` (not `simulate`).

### Issue: Tests failing

**Solution:** Run tests locally first with `pnpm test` before publishing.

### Issue: Act failing locally

**Solution:**

- Ensure Docker is running
- Check that `.actrc` file exists with correct settings
- Try with `--container-architecture linux/amd64` flag

## üéì Examples

### Example 1: Test a Minor Release

```bash
# 1. Simulate locally
pnpm act:publish:simulate

# 2. Simulate on GitHub
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=simulate \
  -f version_increment=minor

# 3. Check simulation summary in GitHub Actions

# 4. Publish for real
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=real \
  -f version_increment=minor
```

### Example 2: Publish Without Version Bump

```bash
# Use existing version, just regenerate changelog and publish
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=real \
  -f version_increment=none
```

### Example 3: Publish to Marketplace Only

```bash
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=real \
  -f version_increment=patch \
  -f publish_marketplace=true \
  -f publish_openvsx=false \
  -f create_release=false
```
