# Publish Workflow Improvements - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented three major improvements to the publish workflow:

1. **Simulation Mode** - Test without actually publishing
2. **Main Branch Synchronization** - Changelog/version changes properly merged
3. **Act Integration** - Local workflow testing

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Simulation Mode ✅

**Problem:** No way to test the publish workflow without actually publishing to marketplaces and creating releases.

**Solution:** Added a `mode` input to the workflow with two options:

- `simulate` (default) - Runs all checks, skips publishing
- `real` - Actually publishes

**Changes Made:**

#### `.github/workflows/publish.yml`

1. **Added `mode` input (lines 6-11):**

   ```yaml
   mode:
     description: "Run mode: simulate (test without publishing) or real (actually publish)"
     required: true
     type: choice
     options:
       - simulate
       - real
     default: simulate
   ```

2. **Updated `prepare-release` job:**
   - Conditional push based on mode
   - Added simulation summary showing what would be pushed

3. **Updated all publish jobs:**
   - `publish-marketplace` - Only runs in `real` mode
   - `publish-openvsx` - Only runs in `real` mode
   - `create-release` - Only runs in `real` mode

4. **Added `simulation-summary` job:**
   - Shows what was tested
   - Shows what was skipped
   - Displays package information
   - Reminds user to use `mode=real` to actually publish

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Safe testing without side effects
- ✅ Verify changelog generation
- ✅ Verify version bumping
- ✅ Verify tests pass
- ✅ Verify build succeeds
- ✅ See exactly what would happen

---

### 2. Main Branch Synchronization ✅

**Problem:** The `prepare-release` job pushed changelog and version changes to `main`, but subsequent jobs (test, build, publish) would checkout `main` **before** those changes, working with outdated files.

**Result:** GitHub release tags had updated files, but `main` branch didn't get them.

**Solution:** Added "Pull Latest Changes" step to all jobs that need the updated files.

**Changes Made:**

#### All affected jobs now

1. **Checkout with fetch-depth: 0:**

   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout
     uses: actions/checkout@v4
     with:
       ref: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && 'main' || github.ref }}
       fetch-depth: 0 # ← Added
   ```

2. **Pull latest changes (workflow_dispatch only):**

   ```yaml
   - name: Pull Latest Changes
     if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && github.event.inputs.mode != 'simulate'
     run: |
       echo "📥 Pulling latest changes from main (including changelog/version updates)..."
       git pull origin main
       echo "✅ Up to date with main"
   ```

**Applied to:**

- `test` job
- `build` job
- `publish-marketplace` job
- `create-release` job

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Changelog updates are in `main` branch
- ✅ Version bumps are in `main` branch
- ✅ GitHub releases match `main` branch
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ All jobs work with latest files

---

### 3. Act Integration ✅

**Problem:** No easy way to test the publish workflow locally before pushing to GitHub.

**Solution:** Added pnpm scripts to run the workflow locally using `act`.

**Changes Made:**

#### `package.json`

Added two new scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "act:publish": "./scripts/act-test.sh workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/publish.yml --input mode=real --input version_increment=patch",
    "act:publish:simulate": "./scripts/act-test.sh workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/publish.yml --input mode=simulate --input version_increment=none"
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Test publish workflow in simulation mode (safe)
pnpm act:publish:simulate

# Test publish workflow in real mode (will try to publish!)
pnpm act:publish
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Test locally before pushing
- ✅ Faster feedback loop
- ✅ No clutter in GitHub Actions history
- ✅ Catch issues early
- ✅ Free CI minutes

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### Before

```
prepare-release (pushes to main)
  ↓
test (checks out old main - missing changes!)
  ↓
build (checks out old main - missing changes!)
  ↓
publish (uses old package.json!)
  ↓
create-release (has changes but main doesn't!)
```

**Result:** GitHub release ✅ but main branch ❌

### After

```
prepare-release (pushes to main in real mode)
  ↓
test (pulls latest main - has all changes! ✅)
  ↓
build (pulls latest main - has all changes! ✅)
  ↓
publish (uses updated package.json! ✅)
  ↓
create-release (pulls latest main - everything in sync! ✅)
```

**Result:** GitHub release ✅ and main branch ✅

---

## 🎨 Simulation Mode Flow

```
User: gh workflow run publish.yml -f mode=simulate -f version_increment=patch
  ↓
prepare-release
  - Generate changelog ✅
  - Bump version ✅
  - Create tag ✅
  - Show dry-run (what would be pushed) ⏭️
  ↓
test
  - Run tests ✅
  - Type check ✅
  - Lint ✅
  ↓
build
  - Build extension ✅
  - Package VSIX ✅
  - Upload artifact ✅
  ↓
publish-marketplace ⏭️ SKIPPED (simulation mode)
  ↓
publish-openvsx ⏭️ SKIPPED (simulation mode)
  ↓
create-release ⏭️ SKIPPED (simulation mode)
  ↓
simulation-summary
  - Show what was tested ✅
  - Show what was skipped ⏭️
  - Display package info 📦
  - Remind about mode=real 💡

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Safe Testing

```bash
# 1. Test locally (fast, no GitHub required)
pnpm act:publish:simulate

# 2. Test on GitHub (uses actual infrastructure)
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=simulate \
  -f version_increment=minor

# 3. Review simulation summary

# 4. Publish for real
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=real \
  -f version_increment=minor
```

### Example 2: Quick Patch Release

```bash
# Test first
gh workflow run publish.yml -f mode=simulate -f version_increment=patch

# Publish
gh workflow run publish.yml -f mode=real -f version_increment=patch
```

### Example 3: Major Release

```bash
# Simulate
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=simulate \
  -f version_increment=major \
  -f skip_changelog=false

# Review carefully

# Publish
gh workflow run publish.yml \
  -f mode=real \
  -f version_increment=major
```
