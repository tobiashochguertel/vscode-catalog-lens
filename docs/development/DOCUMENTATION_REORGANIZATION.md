### 3. Documentation Index

Created comprehensive **docs/INDEX.md** with:
- Complete table of contents
- Topic-based organization
- Quick navigation by category
- Task-based lookup table
- Links to all documentation files

### 4. README Updates

Updated the main **README.md** to:
- Add a "Documentation" section

- Provide quick links to key guides

## 📊 Statistics

### Files Organized
