## 🏗️ Workflow Structure Decision

### Should publish.yml be refactored? **NO** ✅

**Reasoning:**

- Clear job separation (test → build → publish → release)
- Minimal code duplication
- Only 209 lines (appropriate for single file)
- Each job has distinct purpose
- Linear dependency chain is easy to understand

**CI was refactored because:**

- Heavy code duplication
- Complex matrix (Unix/Windows/macOS)
- Shared setup used 6+ times

**Publish stays monolithic because:**

- Each job is unique
- Standard setup pattern (not duplicated logic)
- Simple workflow better as single file
