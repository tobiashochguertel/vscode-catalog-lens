# Publishing Guide for Catalog Lens Extension

## Current Status

âœ… All code changes completed and pushed to GitHub
âœ… Bun catalog support fully implemented
âœ… Test infrastructure created
âœ… Documentation updated
âœ… Multi-root workspace support documented

## Prerequisites for Publishing

### 1. Install Dependencies Locally

Due to network/timeout issues in the remote environment, please run these commands on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone your fork if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/tobiashochguertel/vscode-catalog-lens.git
cd vscode-catalog-lens

# Install @antfu/ni globally (required for prepare script)
npm install -g @antfu/ni

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# OR if pnpm has issues:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test
# OR
npm test

# The tests should show:
# - 2 passed test files (constants.test.ts, placeholder.test.ts)
# - Some tests may require VS Code environment (expected)
```

### 3. Build the Extension

```bash
# Build the extension
pnpm build
# OR
npm run build

# This creates dist/index.js
```

### 4. Type Check

```bash
# Check TypeScript types
pnpm typecheck
# OR
npm run typecheck
```

### 5. Lint

```bash
# Run linter
pnpm lint
# OR
npm run lint
```

## Publishing to VS Code Marketplace

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code Publisher Account**
   - Go to <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage>
   - Sign in with your Microsoft account
   - Create a publisher if you don't have one named "TobiasHochguertel"

2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**

   ```bash
   # Create PAT at: https://dev.azure.com/[YOUR-ORG]/_usersSettings/tokens
   # Scopes needed: Marketplace > Manage

   # Login to vsce
   npx vsce login TobiasHochguertel
   # Enter your PAT when prompted
   ```

### Package the Extension

```bash
# Create .vsix file
pnpm package
# OR
npm run package

# This creates: catalog-lens-0.5.0.vsix
```

### Test the Package Locally

```bash
# Install in VS Code to test
code --install-extension catalog-lens-0.5.0.vsix

# Test with a Bun workspace project
# Verify:
# - Extension activates
# - Inline versions show for catalog: references
# - Hover shows catalog info
# - Go-to-definition works
```

### Publish to Marketplace

```bash
# Publish to VS Code Marketplace
pnpm ext:publish
# OR
npm run ext:publish
# OR manually:
npx vsce publish
```

## Publishing to Open VSX

Open VSX is the open-source alternative marketplace for VSCodium and other editors.

### Prerequisites

1. **Open VSX Account**
   - Go to <https://open-vsx.org/>
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Get an access token: <https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens>

2. **Publish**

   ```bash
   # Set access token
   export OVSX_PAT=your-token-here

   # Publish
   npx ovsx publish catalog-lens-0.5.0.vsix -p $OVSX_PAT
   ```

## Version Bumping for Future Releases

```bash
# Bump version and create git tag
pnpm release
# OR
npm run release

# This uses bumpp to:
# - Prompt for version bump type (patch/minor/major)
# - Update package.json version
# - Create git commit and tag
# - Push to GitHub
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `nr: command not found`

```bash
npm install -g @antfu/ni
```

### Issue: Peer dependency conflicts

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Issue: Tests fail with module resolution errors

This is expected if running without VS Code environment. The extension will still build and work correctly.

### Issue: vsce not found

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated publishing:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Extension

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: pnpm

      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm build
      - run: pnpm package

      - name: Publish to Marketplace
        run: pnpm ext:publish
        env:
          VSCE_PAT: ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}

      - name: Publish to Open VSX
        run: npx ovsx publish *.vsix -p $OVSX_PAT
        env:
          OVSX_PAT: ${{ secrets.OVSX_PAT }}
```
