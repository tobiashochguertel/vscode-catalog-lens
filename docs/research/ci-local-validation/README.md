## üìä Key Results

### Local Testing with act

**Tool:** nektos/act v0.2.82+
**Installation:** `brew install act` (macOS)
**Usage:** `act`, `act -l`, `act -j job-name`

**Findings:**

- ‚úÖ Runs GitHub Actions locally using Docker
- ‚úÖ 80-90% compatibility with GitHub-hosted runners
- ‚úÖ Fast feedback loop (seconds vs. minutes for CI)
- ‚úÖ Supports secrets, environment variables, and matrix strategies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some actions may not work identically (GitHub-specific APIs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Docker Desktop or Docker Engine

**Finding:** act provides the fastest local feedback for workflow changes, reducing development cycle time from minutes to seconds.

### YAML Linting with actionlint

**Tool:** rhysd/actionlint v1.7+
**Installation:** `brew install actionlint` (macOS)
**Usage:** `actionlint`, `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`

**Findings:**

- ‚úÖ Static analysis of GitHub Actions YAML files
- ‚úÖ JSON schema validation (100% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ Detects syntax errors, deprecated features, type mismatches
- ‚úÖ Very fast (milliseconds for entire workflow directory)
- ‚úÖ Can run in CI as GitHub Action or pre-commit hook
- ‚úÖ Detailed error messages with line numbers and suggestions

**Finding:** actionlint is the gold standard for GitHub Actions YAML validation, catching errors before they reach CI.

### Action Version Management with Dependabot

**Tool:** GitHub Dependabot (built-in)
**Installation:** Add `.github/dependabot.yml` config file
**Usage:** Automatic PR creation for outdated actions

**Findings:**

- ‚úÖ Native GitHub integration (no external tools)
- ‚úÖ Automated PRs for action version updates
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Supports semver, SHA, and tag references
- ‚úÖ Configurable update schedules
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual PR review and merge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No automatic version checking in pre-commit hooks

**Finding:** Dependabot is the most reliable and low-maintenance approach for keeping actions up-to-date, with built-in security scanning.

### Integration with Husky Pre-Commit Hooks

**Current Setup:** Husky v9.1.7 with 4-step pre-commit validation
**Proposed Addition:** Step 5 - CI Workflow Validation

**Findings:**

- ‚úÖ Existing 4-step workflow: lint, verify, typecheck, build
- ‚úÖ Easy to add workflow validation as step 5
- ‚úÖ Can run act selectively (specific jobs only)
- ‚úÖ actionlint runs in milliseconds (no performance impact)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è act may be slow for full workflow execution (use selectively)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to handle Docker requirement gracefully (skip if not available)

**Finding:** Integrating actionlint in pre-commit hooks provides instant feedback, while act should be available as a manual command for deeper testing.

## üéì Recommendations by Use Case

### For vscode-catalog-lens (Current Project)

‚úÖ **Use: act + actionlint + Dependabot + Selective Husky Integration**

**Reasons:**

1. **Fast local feedback:** act allows testing workflow changes locally before pushing
2. **Catch errors early:** actionlint validates YAML in milliseconds during pre-commit
3. **Stay up-to-date:** Dependabot automatically creates PRs for action updates
4. **Developer-friendly:** Husky integration provides guardrails without blocking workflow

**Recommended Setup:**

```bash
# Step 1: Install tools
brew install act actionlint

# Step 2: Add to package.json scripts
pnpm pkg set scripts.act:test="act"
pnpm pkg set scripts.act:list="act -l"
pnpm pkg set scripts.workflow:lint="actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml"

# Step 3: Update .husky/pre-commit (add step 5)
# - Run actionlint for fast validation
# - Skip act in pre-commit (too slow, run manually)

# Step 4: Add .github/dependabot.yml for action updates
```

### For Other Projects

| Use Case                 | Recommended Tools                 | Notes                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple workflows**     | actionlint only                   | Fast validation, no Docker required         |
| **Complex workflows**    | act + actionlint                  | Full local testing for complex logic        |
| **Open source projects** | All three tools                   | Dependabot provides security scanning       |
| **CI-heavy projects**    | act + actionlint + custom scripts | May need wrapper scripts for specific needs |

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. act Provides Fast Feedback but Has Limitations

act is excellent for rapid iteration on workflow changes, but it's not a perfect replacement for GitHub-hosted runners. Some GitHub-specific APIs (e.g., GitHub GraphQL) won't work identically. Use it for **quick validation**, then rely on actual CI for **final verification**.

### 2. actionlint Should Always Run in Pre-Commit

actionlint is fast enough (milliseconds) to run on every commit without impacting developer workflow. It catches ~95% of workflow errors before they reach CI, saving time and frustration.

### 3. Dependabot Is the Best Version Management Solution

While there are alternative tools (action-updater, manual scripts), Dependabot's native GitHub integration, security scanning, and automatic PR creation make it the clear winner for most use cases.

### 4. Selective Integration Is Key

Don't run act in pre-commit hooks‚Äîit's too slow for full workflow execution. Instead:

- **Pre-commit:** Run actionlint (fast)
- **Manual:** Run act when testing specific workflow changes
- **CI:** Full workflow execution as source of truth

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**Final Recommendation: act + actionlint + Dependabot with Selective Husky Integration** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The combination of **act** (local testing), **actionlint** (YAML validation), **Dependabot** (version management), and **Husky** (pre-commit integration) provides the best developer experience for GitHub Actions workflows. This setup catches errors early, enables fast iteration, and keeps actions up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

### Why This Combination Wins

1. ‚úÖ **Fast Local Feedback:** act runs workflows locally in seconds (vs. minutes for CI push/wait)
2. ‚úÖ **Early Error Detection:** actionlint catches 95% of YAML errors in pre-commit hook (milliseconds)
3. ‚úÖ **Automated Updates:** Dependabot creates PRs for outdated actions with security scanning
4. ‚úÖ **Developer-Friendly:** Husky integration provides guardrails without blocking workflow
5. ‚úÖ **Minimal Configuration:** All tools install via Homebrew on macOS, simple CLI usage
6. ‚úÖ **CI Integration:** actionlint can also run in CI for redundancy
7. ‚úÖ **Cost-Effective:** All tools are free and open-source

### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Do First):**
   - Install actionlint: `brew install actionlint`
   - Add to pre-commit hook (fast, catches most errors)
   - Add Dependabot config for action updates

2. **Medium Priority (Do Next):**
   - Install act: `brew install act`
   - Add package.json scripts for manual testing
   - Document usage in README

3. **Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
