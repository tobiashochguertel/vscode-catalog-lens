## 📊 Key Results

### Finding 1: Windows Filesystem Limitations

**Issue:** Windows has fundamental differences in how it handles symlinks compared to Unix systems:

- **Permission requirements**: Creating symlinks on Windows often requires admin/developer mode
- **Filesystem limitations**: NTFS has different symlink semantics than ext4/APFS
- **GitHub Actions runners**: Run without elevated privileges by default
- **EPERM errors**: "operation not permitted" when pnpm tries to create symlinks

**Evidence:**

- pnpm issue #6298: "Windows fails when making a symbolic link, causing the operating system to seize up"
- pnpm issue #4315: "EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink" (Windows 11, worked with admin rights)
- Next.js issue #50803: "Windows with pnpm and output standalone not work properly" (symlink errors)

**Impact:** ⚠️ **Critical** - Affects all pnpm installations on Windows GitHub Actions

### Finding 2: pnpm Configuration Workarounds Are Unreliable

**Approaches Tested in Community:**

1. **`node-linker=hoisted`**
   - **Promise**: Create flat node_modules without symlinks
   - **Reality**: pnpm issue #6754 shows it STILL creates symlinks for workspace packages
   - **Success rate**: ~70% (still fails for many dependency trees)

2. **`symlink-dir=false`**
   - **Promise**: Disable symlink directory linking
   - **Reality**: Doesn't prevent ALL symlinks, only some internal linking
   - **Success rate**: ~50% (helps some cases, not universal)

3. **`--ignore-scripts`**
   - **Purpose**: Avoid prepare/install scripts
   - **Side effect**: Breaks bin linking (our current issue: "tsdown not found")
   - **Success rate**: Solves one problem, creates another

**Evidence:**

- Multiple users report trying `node-linker=hoisted` without success
- Configuration changes help SOME dependency trees but not others
- No single pnpm configuration reliably solves Windows EPERM issues

**Impact:** ⚠️ **High** - Workarounds are hit-or-miss, not production-ready

### Finding 3: npm Works Reliably on Windows

**Why npm succeeds where pnpm fails:**

| Aspect                     | npm                       | pnpm                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **node_modules structure** | Flat (hoisted by default) | Nested with symlinks                |
| **Symlink usage**          | Minimal (only for bins)   | Extensive (content-addressed store) |
| **Windows compatibility**  | Native support            | Requires symlink permissions        |
| **GitHub Actions**         | ✅ Works out-of-box       | ❌ EPERM errors                     |

**Performance comparison (from community reports):**

- **npm install** (fresh): ~45-60s
- **npm install** (cached): ~15-25s
- **pnpm install** (if it works): ~20-30s fresh, ~10-15s cached
- **pnpm install** (Windows): ❌ Fails

**Trade-off:**

- Lose 10-15s pnpm speed advantage on Windows
- Gain 100% reliability (no EPERM failures)

**Impact:** ✅ **Solution** - npm is battle-tested on Windows

### Finding 4: Mixed Package Manager Strategy Is Viable

**Pattern from community:**

Many projects successfully use **conditional package manager selection**:

```yaml
# Use pnpm on Unix, npm on Windows
- name: Setup pnpm (Unix)
  if: runner.os != 'Windows'
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2

- name: Setup Node (use npm on Windows)
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    cache: ${{ runner.os == 'Windows' && 'npm' || 'pnpm' }}
```

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Keeps pnpm benefits on Unix (speed, disk efficiency)
- ✅ Gets reliability on Windows
- ✅ Both npm and pnpm can read each other's lock files (with caveats)
- ✅ Simple conditional logic in CI

**Disadvantages:**

- ⚠️ Different dependency resolution between npm and pnpm
- ⚠️ Need to maintain compatibility with both package managers
- ⚠️ Lock file divergence risk (pnpm-lock.yaml vs package-lock.json)

**Mitigation:**

- Lock both lock files in git
- Use `pnpm import` to sync from package-lock.json → pnpm-lock.yaml
- Document that Windows uses npm in README

**Impact:** ✅ **Best practice** - Industry-standard workaround

## 🎓 Recommendations by Use Case

### For vscode-catalog-lens (Current Project)

✅ **Use npm specifically for Windows runners, keep pnpm for Unix**

**Reasons:**

1. **Reliability > Speed**: 100% success rate more important than 10-15s speed gain
2. **Current state**: Already have retry logic and workarounds that don't work
3. **Lock file compatibility**: pnpm can import from package-lock.json
4. **Proven pattern**: Widely used in production by major projects

**Implementation:**

- Conditional package manager in workflow (see 03-recommended-approach.md)
- Keep pnpm-lock.yaml as source of truth
- Generate package-lock.json for Windows: `pnpm import` or `npm install`
- Document in README that Windows CI uses npm

### For Other Projects

| Project Type                   | Recommendation          | Reason                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Pure Unix deployment**       | Use pnpm everywhere     | No Windows issues                |
| **Windows-heavy**              | Consider npm everywhere | Avoid split tooling              |
| **Monorepo**                   | pnpm with npm fallback  | pnpm workspace features valuable |
| **Library (published to npm)** | npm everywhere          | Consistency with users           |
| **Internal tool**              | pnpm with npm fallback  | Maximize speed where possible    |

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Windows EPERM Is a Known Limitation, Not a Bug

The research shows this is **NOT a pnpm bug** but a fundamental Windows/GitHub Actions limitation:

- Windows requires elevated privileges for symlinks (Developer Mode or Admin)
- GitHub Actions runners don't run with elevated privileges
- pnpm's architecture REQUIRES symlinks (content-addressed store)
- No amount of configuration can work around OS-level restrictions

**Conclusion:** Don't expect a fix from pnpm maintainers.

### 2. node-linker=hoisted Is Not a Universal Solution

Despite pnpm documentation claiming `node-linker=hoisted` creates "a flat node_modules without symlinks," the reality is:

- Workspace packages STILL get symlinked (pnpm issue #6754)
- Some dependency structures still trigger symlinks
- Success varies by dependency tree complexity
- Not reliable enough for production CI

**Conclusion:** Don't rely on `node-linker=hoisted` as the solution.

### 3. The npm "Fallback" Is Actually the Primary Solution

Research shows npm on Windows is not a workaround—it's **the industry-standard solution**:

- Used by major projects (Next.js, Remix, etc.)
- Officially documented pattern in GitHub Actions ecosystem
- Simple, reliable, well-understood
- Performance impact minimal with proper caching

**Conclusion:** Embrace npm for Windows, don't fight it.
