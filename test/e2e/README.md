# E2E Tests - Currently Disabled

## Status

⚠️ **E2E tests are currently disabled in CI** pending proper Mocha integration with @vscode/test-electron.

## Issue

The E2E tests are failing with:

```
ReferenceError: suite is not defined
```

## Root Cause

When using `@vscode/test-electron`, Mocha's globals (`suite`, `test`, `suiteSetup`, etc.) need to be available in the VS Code extension host process. While we've added `types: ["mocha"]` to `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation, the compiled JavaScript still expects Mocha globals to be available at runtime in the extension host.

## Current Workaround

E2E tests have been disabled in the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) but the test infrastructure remains in place for future use.

## Unit and Integration Tests

The following tests are **fully functional** and running in CI:

- ✅ **Unit Tests** (43 tests)
  - Logger singleton tests
  - Utils tests
  - Data module tests
  - Constants tests

- ✅ **Integration Tests**
  - WorkspaceManager tests (PNPM, Yarn, Bun)
  - File system integration tests

All critical functionality is covered by unit and integration tests.

## Manual Testing

To manually test the extension:

1. **Build the extension:**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Launch Extension Development Host:**
   - Press `F5` in VSCode
   - Or: Run > Start Debugging

3. **Open a test workspace:**
   - Use `test/e2e/workspaces/test-workspace/`
   - Or create your own with catalog references

4. **Verify functionality:**
   - Open Output panel (View → Output)
   - Select "Catalog Lens (PNPM|YARN|BUN)"
   - Open `packages/app/package.json`
   - Hover over `"catalog:"` references
   - Should see version information ✅

## Future Work

To enable E2E tests in CI, one of these approaches could be used:

1. **Use Vitest with `@vscode/test-electron`**
   - Convert E2E tests to Vitest format
   - May require custom setup for VS Code integration

2. **Use different test runner**
   - Explore alternatives to Mocha for E2E tests
   - Consider Playwright Test or Jest

3. **Fix Mocha integration**
   - Properly configure Mocha globals in extension host
   - May require custom test runner setup

## Test Files

The E2E test infrastructure is in place:

```
test/e2e/
├── README.md (this file)
├── runTests.ts              # Test runner
├── tsconfig.json            # TypeScript config with Mocha types

```

## Contributing

If you'd like to fix the E2E test integration:

1. See the issue description above
2. Test your fix locally with `pnpm test:e2e`
3. Ensure it works with `xvfb-run -a pnpm test:e2e` (Linux)
4. Re-enable the E2E job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
5. Submit a PR!
